# Behavior, Strategy, Implementation

[<< Week 3](./week-3/README.md) | Main Page | [Week 1 >>](./week-1/README.md)

> Be creative while inventing ideas, but be disciplined while implementing them.
> - [Amit Kalantri](https://amitkalantri.com/tag/quotes-about-creativity/)

- Behavior: What does code do? What are it’s arguments and it’s return value? How could you use it in a program? Behavior is checked by tests
- Strategy: How could you transform the arguments to the return value in small steps, focusing on the data not the code. This is the realm of flow charts, diagrams, and pseudocode.
- Implementation: Which language features and which lines of code can you use to make your strategy a reality?

## Getting Started

> You will need [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) on your computer to study this material
>
> Using a browser with good DevTools will make your life easier: [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

1. Install or update the `study-lenses` package globally
    - `$ npm install -g study-lenses` (if you do not have it already)
    - `$ npm update -g study-lenses` (if you already have it installed)
2. Clone this repository
    - `$ git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging.git`
3. `cd` into the repository
    - `$ cd debugging`
4. Open the repository using `study`
    - `$ study`
5. The material will open in your default browser, you're good to go!

> If you have a windows computer and get this error:
>
> - `... /study.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts ...`
>
> follow the instructions in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63424744), that should take care of it ; )

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand!  Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples!  Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Write lots of good comments, learn more about this in [./studying-javascript](./studying-javascript)
- Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
- Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips
